Run this - 
stsadm -o setproperty -pn peoplepicker-searchadforests -pv "forest:mainforest.com;domain:domain1.com;domain:domain2.int" -urlÂ <WebAppURL>

and this
$webapp = Get-SPWebApplication "<WebAppUrl>"
$ws = $webapp.WebService
$ws.PeoplePickerSearchInMultipleForests = $True
$ws.update()

Troubleshooting, make sure the other domains are in one-way/two-way trust and there are no Firewall restrictions for SP servers.
